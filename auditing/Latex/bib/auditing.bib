	abstract = {A perennial challenge in the accounting profession is how to aggregate and share instances of practitioner misconduct amongst numerous relevant parties. At present, both the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) offer solutions for centralized collection of misconduct, but both likely experience issues with incomplete reporting from key constituents. I propose a novel use of blockchain technology to address this issue, such that all key parties in the accounting profession leverage an Accountancy Blockchain to aggregate and share instances of practitioner misconduct across the country on a nearly real-time basis. Such a network creates an immutable record of misconduct and allows key constituents in the accounting profession to work together and share information as peers without the risk of one party taking control of the ledger. I close by discussing blockchain-specific roadblocks to realizing this proposed model.},

Researchers and organisations are starting to understand the potential benefits of this technology and are exploring how it can disrupt the world we live in with a diverse range of applications. But the truth is the ability to move blockchain from concept to adoption and production has been minimal yet. When it comes to auditing, blockchain solutions could have important benefits by reducing the workload of the auditors, helping in minimising fraud and optimising the existing processes but is also vital to have in mind other emerging technologies. Factom, Libra, and Verady are some examples of companies developing blockchain solutions that can be applied in the auditing environment, but much of the necessary development is still yet to be done.},

Much discussion to date has assumed that the U.S. government's opposition to strong cryptography, such as its key escrow proposals, is the primary obstacle to widespread use of anonymous electronic cash. For purposes of this paper, I assume that strong cryptography is legal and readily available. Even in that event, I claim that strong cryptography will be used to preserve anonymity only in a highly restricted subset of financial transactions. Furthermore, because technology often will not assure privacy, legal rules can and should play an important supplementary role in the protection of privacy in f'manclalwansactions.},

	abstract = {Emerging electronic commerce services that use public-key cryptography on a mass-market scale require sophisticated mechanisms for managing trust. For example, any service that receives a signed request for action is forced to answer the central question "Is the key used to sign this request authorized to take this action?" In some services, this question reduces to "Does this key belong to this person?" In others, the authorization question is more complicated, and resolving it requires techniques for formulating security policies and security credentials, determining whether particular sets of credentials satisfy the relevant policies, and deferring trust to third parties. Blaze, Feigenbaum, and Lacy [1] identified this trust management problem as a distinct and important component of network services and described a general tool for addressing it, the PolicyMaker trust management system.},
