\subsection{What is frontrunning?} %Definition of frontrunning
%Traditional
%WRT blockchain and decentralization
\subsection{Miners and their power} 
%Transaction order, can be used for frontrunning

\section{Frontrunning Attacks}

\subsection{Financial Markets}
%oders, exchanges

\subsection{Non-financial Applications}
Applications, Ghazal, register domains before the user, (domain squatting?) \par\noindent
Other applications (look at Dapps or other blockchain use cases)\par\noindent
Arbitrage (buy before the order, sell to the original order) (other scenarios)\par\noindent
Maker griefing (attack on the system?s reputation itself)\par\noindent
Etherdelta case: Fill the order when cancelling transaction is sent. What would be the profitable scenario here?

\section{Implications}

Historical evidence of such attacks:\par\noindent
Status ICO [link]\par\noindent
Bancor frontrunning [link, link]\par\noindent
?
New attacks:\par\noindent
Ghazal\par\noindent
Find more applications to frontrun, not necessarily monetary gain/financial

\section{Mitigations}

Commit / reveal methods
\begin{itemize}
\item{Send the hash first, send the actual data after (sealed-bid auctions)}
\item{Proof of burn methods (generate random addresses with no private keys)}
\end{itemize}
Submarines
\begin{itemize}
\item{The method described in HD can be optimized and more functional with the new changes to ethereum and solidity}
\item{Submarines 2.0: There can be a new way of doing this (new WRT hackingditributed article), can predict smart contract addresses using the nonce and data of the contract (forwarder/refunder), so funds can be sent to these addresses and then contracts can be deployed} 
\begin {itemize}
\item{Pros: new addresses, no indication of the order (Anonymity-set)}
\item{Cons: DDoS? Requires 3 transactions for each order?} >> 1 send the funds 2 Deploy the contract 3 call the function
\end{itemize}
\item{Other methods? Consensus protocol based solutions?}

\end{itemize}
