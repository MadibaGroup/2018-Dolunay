We consider \textit{Front-running} to be any course of action during which an entity benefits from prior access to privileged market information about upcoming transactions and trades. Front-running has been an issue in traditional financial instrument markets since 70's. Lately, with the advent of the blockchain technology, front-running resurfaced in new forms, due to decentralization and transparency.
In this paper, we consider instances of front-running across the top 25 decentral applications (DApps) deployed on Ethereum. Additionally, we carry out detailed analysis of Status.im Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and show evidence of abnormal miner's behaviour indicative of front-running token purchases.  
Furthermore, we introduce a framework for categorizing proposed solutions to front-running and examine the applicability to the identified issues.
